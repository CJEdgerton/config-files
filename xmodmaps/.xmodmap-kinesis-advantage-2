! Remap keys on Kinesis Advantage 2
! This is a working version with the following
! 1) Option to remap alt key (left or right) to super (left or right)
! 2) Search/Capslock key remapped to Escape at keyboard level (to avoid caps lock light)

! 1) Remap an Alt key to a Super key
! 2) Need to do the remap first then empty and reset the Mod keys
! This order is important because if you remap after #2 then 
! the key will be moved to an unexpected mod key

! keysym Alt_R = Super_R
keysym Alt_L = Super_L

clear Mod1
clear Mod4

add Mod1 = Alt_L
add Mod1 = Alt_R

add Mod4 = Super_L
add Mod4 = Super_R
