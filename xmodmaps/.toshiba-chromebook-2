! Remap keys on Toshiba CB2 keyboard
! This is a working version with the following
! 1) Top row keys remapped to f1-f12
! 2) Option to remap alt key (left or right) to super (left or right)
! 3) Search/Capslock key remapped to Escape

! Set top row keys to f1-f12
keysym Escape = F1
keysym F1 = F2
keysym F2 = F3
keysym F3 = F4
keysym F4 = F5
keysym F5 = F6
keysym F6 = F7
keysym F7 = F8
keysym F8 = F9
keysym F9 = F10
keysym F10 = F11
! Remember to set 'HandlePowerKey=ignore' in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
keysym XF86PowerOff = F12


! 1) Remap an Alt key to a Super key
! 2) Need to do the remap first then empty and reset the Mod keys
! This order is important because if you remap after #2 then 
! the key will be moved to an unexpected mod key

! keysym Alt_R = Super_R
keysym Alt_L = Super_L

clear Mod1
clear Mod4

add Mod1 = Alt_L
add Mod1 = Alt_R

add Mod4 = Super_L
add Mod4 = Super_R

! Remap CapsLock (Super_L on TCB2) to Escape
keysym Super_L = Escape
